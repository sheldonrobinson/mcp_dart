The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standardized protocol for communication between AI applications and external services. It enables:

- **Tools**: Allow AI to execute actions (API calls, computations, etc.)
- **Resources**: Provide context and data to AI (files, databases, APIs)
- **Prompts**: Pre-built prompt templates with arguments

## Understanding MCP: Client, Server, and Host

MCP follows a **client-server architecture** with three key components:

- **MCP Host**: The AI application that provides the user interface and manages connections to multiple MCP servers.
  - Example: Claude Desktop, IDEs like VS Code, custom AI applications
  - Manages server lifecycle, discovers capabilities, and orchestrates interactions

- **MCP Client**: The protocol implementation within the host that communicates with servers.
  - Handles protocol negotiation, capability discovery, and request/response flow
  - Typically built into or used by the MCP host

- **MCP Server**: Provides capabilities (tools, resources, prompts) that AI can use through the host.
  - Example: Servers for file system access, database queries, or API integrations
  - Runs as a separate process and communicates via standardized transports (stdio, StreamableHTTP)

**Typical Flow**: User ↔ MCP Host (with Client) ↔ MCP Protocol ↔ Your Server ↔ External Services/Data

## Requirements

- Dart SDK version ^3.0.0 or higher

Ensure you have the correct Dart SDK version installed. See <https://dart.dev/get-dart> for installation instructions.

## What This SDK Provides

**This SDK lets you build both MCP servers and clients in Dart/Flutter.**

- ✅ **Build MCP Servers** - Create servers that expose tools, resources, and prompts to AI hosts
- ✅ **Build MCP Clients** - Create AI applications that can connect to and use MCP servers
- ✅ **Full MCP Protocol Support** - Complete [MCP specification 2025-11-25](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-11-25) implementation
- ✅ **Multiple Transport Options** - Stdio, StreamableHTTP, Stream, or custom transports
- ✅ **All Capabilities** - Tools, Resources, Prompts, Sampling, Roots, Completions, Elicitation, Tasks
- ✅ **OAuth2 Support** - Complete authentication with PKCE
- ✅ **Type-Safe** - Comprehensive type definitions with null safety
- ✅ **Cross-Platform** - Works on Linux, Windows, macOS, Web, and Flutter

The goal is to make this SDK as similar as possible to the official SDKs available in other languages, ensuring a consistent developer experience across platforms.

## Model Context Protocol Version

## Quick Start with CLI

The fastest way to create an MCP server is using the `mcp_dart_cli`:

```bash
# Install the CLI
dart pub global activate mcp_dart_cli

# Create a new project
mcp_dart create my_server

# Navigate and run
cd my_server
mcp_dart serve
```

Your server is now running! Use `mcp_dart inspect` to test it:

```bash
mcp_dart inspect              # List all capabilities
mcp_dart inspect --tool add --json-args '{"a": 1, "b": 2}'   # Call a tool
```

### CLI Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `create` | Scaffold a new MCP server project |
| `serve` | Run your server (stdio or HTTP) |
| `doctor` | Check project health and connectivity |
| `inspect` | Test and debug server capabilities |

### Connecting to AI Hosts

Configure your server with AI hosts like Claude Desktop:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "my_server": {
      "command": "mcp_dart",
      "args": ["serve"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/my_server"
    }
  }
}
```

> [!TIP]
> For manual server implementation or advanced use cases, see the [Server Guide](https://github.com/leehack/mcp_dart/blob/main/doc/server-guide.md).

## Authentication

This library supports OAuth2 authentication with PKCE for both clients and servers. For complete authentication guides and examples, see the [OAuth Authentication documentation](https://github.com/leehack/mcp_dart/blob/main/example/authentication/).

## Platform Support

| Platform | Stdio | StreamableHTTP | Stream | Custom |
|----------|-------|----------------|--------|--------|
| **Desktop** (CLI/Server) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Web** (Browser) | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Flutter** (Mobile/Desktop) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

**Custom Transports**: You can implement your own transport layer by extending the transport interfaces if you need specific communication patterns not covered by the built-in options.
